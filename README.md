NAME
INTERCAAT (Interface Contact definition with Adaptable Atom Types software)

SYNOPSIS
This program uses a PDB file to identify the residues present in the interface 
between a query chain and an interacting chain(s)

PRE-REQUISITES
1. Python 3.8 or newer is required. INTERCAAT was tested in Centos7 and MacOS 11.4.  

2. Numpy is required, to install run command 
   in Linux: "pip install numpy --user"
   in Mac  : "pip3 install numpy --user"

3. Scipy is required, to install run command 
   in Linux: "pip install scipy --user"
   in Mac  : "pip3 install scipy --user"

4. Qhull is recommended since it is much faster. Qhull can be downloaded from here: http://www.qhull.org/download/.

TEST
We included a sample PDB and the expected results from running the test commands below:
python intercaat.py -pdb 1cph.pdb -qc B -ic A 
python intercaat.py -pdb 1cph.pdb -qc A,6,7,8,9 -ic B -di no -cc no -sr 1.7 

CONFIGURATION
For ease of use, INTERCAAT is set to calculate the voronoi tesselations with the Python implementation by default.
To speed up INTERCAAT, switch for this caclulation to be done with qhull. To accomplish this you must set "run_python_version = no"
and specify the "qvoronoi_path" variable to your local qhull qvoronoi executable location in the intercaat_config.txt file.

HELP
The help function for INTERCAAT can be displayed by typing either intercaat.py or intercaat.py -h into 
your terminal. After doing so, instructions for how to run this program along with an 
example for each switch will be shown.

OUTPUT
The main output of this program displays every atomic interaction between the query chain 
and the interacting chain(s), the distance between the interacting atoms, and the assigned 
atom classes. The compatibility matrix, if displayed, shows each interface residue in the 
query chain and its corresponding quantity of atomic interactions.
